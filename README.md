Priority Queue Implementations
==============================

This short program shows three different implementaions of queues, used
mostly for profiling purposes.

The three will be a naive priority queue consisting of a circularly linked list,
a heap implemented as an array,
and a heap implemented without an array, with a personal algorithm to determine
where the next free leaf is
